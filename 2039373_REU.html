                     <p> This summer project, spanning approximately three months, aimed to develop threat modeling scenarios that are relatable to high school students to personalize their learning of Identity and Access Management (IAM) technologies. The project design included group brainstorming to identify threat scenarios most suitable for classroom instruction that appeal to studentsâ€™ everyday contexts. Specifically, we aimed to identify threat and attack scenarios that students may regularly face (or are familiar with) related to IAM, like password attacks through shoulder surfing from a classmate or use of biometrics on smartphones. Our hypothesis was that by personalizing learning in this way, student engagement and learning will be positively impacted, as opposed to relying on existing teaching strategies that do not produce consistently positive learning outcomes.</p>
                     
                                          <p>This study was approved by USF's Institutional Review Board as Study #005606, and was funded by NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Program, Grant #2039373.</p>

                     <p>Ten undergraduate students were recruited for this study through various channels, including:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Email invitations</li>
                        <li>USF social media platforms</li>
                        <li>Paper flyers distributed across campus and within on-campus residence halls</li>
                        <li>Campus-wide email distributions</li>
                        <li>Recruitment videos</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Additionally, study flyers were shared with our established collaborators for dissemination to potential participants and were made available in the university student center. Eight participants reported enrollment in the Computer Science and Engineering program, with two individuals also enrolled in Medical Engineering, all of whom are affiliated with the University of South Florida's College of Engineering.</p>
                     
                     <p>Each participant completed a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/quiz/cybersecurity-knowledge/" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Knowledge Quiz</a> prior to participating in the study to assess their overall cybersecurity awareness. This was important to ensure each participant could effectively participate in discussion during the study.</p>

                     <p>Each participant received:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>A $75 e-gift card per brainstorming session</li>
                        <li>A $50 e-gift card for completing the final focus group</li>

                        <li>Discussion (15 minutes)</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Lunch was served at the start of the session. Participants were welcomed to continue eating during the study overview, during which the study facilitators presented a slide deck which detailed the study goals, provided an ice breaker, defined fundamental concepts, and established a schedule for the day.</p>
                     <p>During brainstorming time, participants broke into two groups, during which they were instructed to generate ideas with the following in mind:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Quantity over quality</li>
                        <li>No idea is a bad idea</li>
                        <li>Creative and wild ideas are encouraged</li>
                        <li>Jot down everything</li>
                        <li>Avoid criticizing or praising ideas</li>
                        <li>Avoid lengthy discussion</li>
                        <li>Use many tools to express your ideas</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Participants were provided with a wide array of stationary during all sessions, including markers, mini whiteboards and dry erase markers, pens, paper pads, sticky notes, index cards, and stickers. During discussion, each group would present their ideas and the whole team would reflect and discuss commonalities and the research team would ask questions to gain clarity.</p>

                     <h3>Findings</h3>

                     <p>Overall outcomes from Brainstorming Session 1 showed general support for the use of personalized threat scenarios for high school students to teach cybersecurity concepts. Real-world threats were highlighted as essential for enhancing memorability and relevance. However, to conclude Session 1, we held a 15-minute open discussion, which yielded further insights from both groups. Group A raised questions about the feasibility of true personalization, emphasizing the need for engaging activities over personalized ones. They highlighted the discrepancy between current personalized approaches and real-world scenarios, suggesting that effective personalization requires a deep understanding of the individual. As a result, their goal for the next session evolved to develop a set of engaging and relevant activities that promote positive and ethical behaviors among students. Group B's final comments in Session 1 centered on the potential negative consequences of personalized content, including the risk of fostering "bad hacking mentalities" and influencing unethical behavior. As an alternative, they proposed introducing concepts like Blue Teams and Bug Bounty Programs to mitigate these risks while making students more aware of cybersecurity issues like phishing emails. Thus, their objective for the next session also evolved to create a set of large problem-solving projects that address cybersecurity challenges on a broader scale. </p>
